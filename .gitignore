I am Stephen and a freelancer who is working on upwork.com
Have ever heard of that site.

Currently, my upwork account is suspened. And I can't create a new one account anymore because upwork needs the ID verification.

If you don't work there, could you please lend me your upwork account?
Instead of using your account, I will give you 50$ per month.
That's my deal.
