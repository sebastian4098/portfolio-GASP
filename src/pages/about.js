                    I'm <u>Stephen Anselm</u>.<br></br>
                    <br></br>I am a computer engineer and a full time freelancer
                    as a Full Stack Web Developer. <br />
                    <br />
                    After I got my first project as a freelancer I realized that
                    this is what I wanted to do.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Looking over the projects I have completed and my
                    clients' feedbacks means a lot to me and always keeps me
                    going. <br />
                    <br />
                    As much as I like to create long working relations with my
                    clients, I am always eager to work with new clients. You can
                    find me on upwork.
                    <br />
                    <br /> I believe the best thing I gained over my vast
                    experience is the ability to work out of my comfort zone.
                    <br />
                    If I don't know something that doesn't mean I can't do it.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br> I am also an avid photographer and freelancer.
                    <br></br> <br></br>
                    Combining these skills, I bring beautiful digital
                    experiences to life. At heart, I am a creator: <br></br>I
                    believe in aesthetics with purpose.

                    I build websites with MERN, LAMP, Django, WordPress, Drupal,
                    Grav, and Gatsby.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>I write HTML, (S)CSS, front-end JavaScript, jQuery,
                    JSX, PHP, and Twig.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>I design and prototype in Adobe XD, Figma, Sketch,
                    Adobe Illustrator, and InVision.
                    <br></br>

                    I double majored in Design and Studio Art at Lehigh
                    University, with a concentration in Design and Studio Art.
                    In my last year of college, I taught myself how to code and
                    push my designs to the world wide web.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    After a couple years of agency experience, it became clear
                    that web design and development was my passion. So, I
                    decided to learn programming fundamentals in a formal
                    setting, at a coding bootcamp called General Assembly, where
                    I learned JavaScript and React.js in a rigorous environment.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Currently, I operate my own freelance website development,
                    interface design and professional photography enterprise.
                    Right now, I'm seeking a creative developer + designer role.
