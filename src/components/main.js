                                        I've had them! I have a thing for making
                                        websites for restaurants. This freelance
                                        opportunity that I chased down, involved
                                        a complete redesign and redevelopment of
                                        their aging godaddy website.

                                        They wanted a colorful site that users
                                        could navigate easily, with key
                                        information and restaurant specials
                                        being visible at a glance. The owners
                                        also wanted to be able to edit any of
                                        their content at any time - a natural
                                        fit for WordPress and advanced custom
                                        fields.

                                        After intense work and collabarative
                                        iterations (being both the designer and
                                        the developer), the launch was a
                                        resounding success. What stood out for
                                        me most when working on this site was
                                        being able to play and design with
                                        savory imagery, expressive colors and
                                        bold typography. In addition to paying
                                        me, they also sent me a box of their
                                        delectable pretzels!

                                        aims to end pet homelessness - it's also
                                        the only animal charity in L.A. that

                                        hospital too.

                                        As a creative developer at ForumOne, I
                                        was bestowed the honor of designing this
                                        website from scratch as well as building
                                        it. Despite the simplicity of
                                        Squarespace, I was able to push the
                                        level of design by incorporating fresh
                                        use of geometry, vibrant colors, a crisp
                                        San Serif, eye-catching interactions and
                                        modern design elements.

                                        Since 1976, they’ve rescued and placed
                                        10,000s of dogs and cats into loving
                                        homes - I'm glad I was able to help them
                                        continue their mission. Gotta love those
                                        puppy eyes!

                                        The FüdTruk was a mobile culinary unit
                                        on Lehigh University Campus that used
                                        locally sourced food to make incredible
                                        sandwiches, breakfast, lunch foods and

                                        This was one of my first freelance gigs
                                        and I branded them completely - from
                                        their logo, to their color scheme, to
                                        the vinyl wrap on their truck. It was an
                                        undertaking that lead to more and more
                                        opportunities with FüdTruk, as I was
                                        later tasked with all the photography,
                                        videography, web design and development!

                                        The site itself was a simple Drupal 7

                                        one-pager with an emphasis on scrolling,
                                        content and ease of use. Being one of my

                                        Their website has been rock-solid for
                                        the past 4 years now, with their
                                        products now being available in more
                                        than 30 locations and counting and an
                                        expansion to consumer goods. I'm going
                                        to be working on a new website redesign
                                        and redevelopment in React.js. Coming
                                        soon!

                                        While at Weidenhammer Creative, I helped

                                        WordPress, including advanced custom
                                        field creation, and component/page

                                        these little nuts are the glue that
                                        holds America tight!

                                        While employed at Lehigh University, and
                                        after other successful design and
                                        development endeavors at Lehigh, I was
                                        saught out by the College of Arts +
                                        Design for a complete redesign and
                                        development of their dated Drupal
                                        website.
                                        <br></br>
                                        <br></br>A bold, contemporary approach
                                        for their new vision was paramount:
                                        highlighting the modern programs,
                                        facilities and learning opportunities
                                        that would attract students to Lehigh's
                                        Arts programs for years to come was no
                                        easy feat.
                                        <br></br>
                                        <br></br>I designed a clean, lean UI
                                        scheme and website with a limited
                                        palette, flat colors, ample white space
                                        and easier navigation while development
                                        in Drupal 7 was a straightforward
                                        process. I wish this site around when I
                                        was a student at Lehigh!

                    I worked extensively with the different department heads
                    within the College of Arts and Design to create a new web
                    experience that highlighted their intricate programs and
                    facilities. These internal designs are a testament to that,
                    where I worked extensively with the department heads on an
                    aesthetic and content management.

                    While working at Lehigh University, I was in charge of the
                    Portal software they used which everyone logged in on to
                    check the campus news and facilities. Being a designer and
                    developer, I advocated for a full redesign of the portal
                    with create a more contemporary, user focused look with
                    extensive testing with retainability - it was graced with a
                    best portal design award at PABug!

                    One of my most ambitious and exciting web designs - the
                    college of Engineering at Lehigh University asked for a full
                    redesign of the website and sub-sites. This was a pure
                    design project where I was extensively with the head of the
                    college and auxiliary professors on crafting and designing a
                    branding theme and scheme that fit that the main college
                    while also having assets and design elements trickle into
                    the sub sites. An extensive undertaking that turned out to
                    be very fruitful!
